        </h3>

        <p>I've been part of several discussions that argue for and against building applications with microservices. In
            response, I've introduced the below diagram and associated architecture to show the evolution of a
            distributed system starting from a single application and evolving into several applications and services.
            Starting with a single application is just as viable as starting with microservices, it simply depends on
            how much information you're given.</p>

        <p><img class="continuum" src="images/continuum_graphic4x.png" alt=""></p>

        <p>Projects could start anywhere on the continuum, typically driven by the amount of information a team has
            about an application or set of applications. The amount of information is often driven by product /market
            fit. The less you know about a given market, which is typically common for startups, the further left you'd
            start. The more you know about a given market, the further right. Large, enterprise business-to-business
            applications, for example, tend to experience low market risk but often face high execution risk. Hence the
            tendency for enterprises to start on the far right of the continuum.</p>


        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Why is all this important?</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The continuum is language agnostic and applies to any modern programming language. This architecture helps
            reduce the cost of changing code as customer needs evolve. It provides developers and product owners the
            ability to use, reuse, and replace components within a given codebase to both pivot existing products and
            easily create new ones.</p>


        <div class="info">
            <h3>

                <a id="project-structure" class="anchor" href="#project-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span
                        aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Structure</h3>

            <p>The example codebase uses a few select dependencies to emphasise the continuum steps.
                Understanding the building blocks will help you understand your chosen framework. I've also selected
                Kotlin as my programming language.</p>
            <p>I've used a series of Git commit tags to illustrate each step.</p>

            <pre><code>$ git tag -ln

v1    First commit
v2    Functional groups
v3    Feature groups (Bounded content)
v4    Components
v5    Applications
v6    Services

</code></pre>

            <p>The example project is a software project management tool similar to Pivotal Tracker. Although not the
                actual codebase, Tracker followed a very similar evolution in application architecture. I've penciled in
                a few key epic features - Allocations, Backlog Management, and Time Tracking.</p>

            <p>I've focused on the back-end development, but there's no reason you couldn't take a similar
                approach for the front end development. The project includes only a few dependencies and resides within
                a single Git repository.</p>

            <p>Here's a helpful command when moving through the Git tags -</p>

            <pre><code>$ git checkout v1 &amp;&amp; git clean -df
</code></pre>
        </div>


        <h3>
            <a id="single-application" class="anchor" href="#single-application" aria-hidden="true"><span
                    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single Application</h3>

        <h5>
            <a id="v1-tag-first-commit" class="anchor" href="#v1-tag-first-commit" aria-hidden="true"><span
                    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First commit</h5>

        <p>The v1 tag starts with a flat directory structure. This step, while slightly naive, demonstrates a reasonable
            starting point having made no decisions around architecture. No groupings, no components, no services. Just
            a single, flat directory structure with class files.</p>

        <h5>
            <a id="v2-tag-functional-groups" class="anchor" href="#v2-tag-functional-groups" aria-hidden="true"><span
                    aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functional groups</h5>

        <p>v2 moves classes into Models, Controllers, Data Access Layer, and Utilities directories. I've noticed this
            directory structure over the years in many popular frameworks, although I've found that as your application
            evolves, a change to a small feature tends to drive changes through your entire codebase.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Would you ever put all your Integers in one file?</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Functional groups become increasingly painful to maintain as teams grow and the complexity and size of the
            codebase increases. This is especially true when dependencies are not fully understood. I've found that
            this
            is typically the result of accidental design versus intentional design. For this reason, I've
            reverted the
            Functional groups commit in favor of v3, Feature groups.</p>

            groups (Bounded content)</h5>

        <p>The v3 commit moves classes into feature groups or <a
                href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html">bounded contexts</a>. The benefits of bounded
            contexts are readability and a step toward isolated (loosely coupled, highly cohesive) components.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Why is readability important?</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Imagine you've just joined the team and pulled the next story from the top of the backlog, Update Timesheets.
            With functional groups, you would have to scan the entire codebase for timesheet related file changes. As
            the size of your codebase increases, the potential to overlook associated files that also need updating
            increases. Again, this is especially true as codebases increase in both size and complexity. Using feature
            groups or bounded contexts, all the timesheet related files are in one place with any complexity confined to
            a single directory.</p>

        <p>The step toward single responsibility directories, while small, positions the codebase for v4, individual
            components with bounded contexts.</p>

        <p><span class="architecture">Design decision</span> I've avoided the use of a "common" or "util" directory in favor of, in this case,
            jdbc-support and rest-support directories. Common or Util tells me absolutely nothing about the containing classes other than
            they may be shared by every class in the codebase. Avoiding common, util or similar "generic" directories will allow you to evolve your codebase on a moment's notice.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="architecture">Design decision</span>
            Database tests re-query the table data after data creation to ensure that records are actually persisted in the database.
        </p>

        <span class="architecture">Design decision</span> Test package names are different than source package names.
        This is to ensure the intended level of encapsulation and reveal accidental design choices. It should be
        extremely
        painful for people to test package / private methods.

        <p>In the v4 commit I've extracted the Users, Accounts, and Projects components. I've also extracted components
            for rest-support and jdbc-support, making a conscious effort to avoid creating a "common" package.</p>

        <p>The main characteristic of the v4 commit is that each component is individually built and tested. This is
            similar to feature groups (loosely coupled and highly cohesive). Dependencies are clearly described within
            the build file and circular dependencies are resolved. The v4 commit sets us up nicely to introduce
            Services.</p>

        <p>I've created a single databases directory although this is slightly atypical. Data definition language within each component is more common, permitting a per component data store.
            </p>

        <span class="architecture">Design decision</span> I've chosen to create a Jdbc Template
        over an Object Relational Mapping library. This is because the bidirectional nature of JPA or similar libraries
        can lead to the accidental introduction of circular dependencies which make it painful to evolve a codebase. Database tables are not necessarily Objects and you shouldn't think about them as such.

        </h5>

        <p>The v5 commit introduces 4 distinct applications - Allocations, Backlog, Registration, and Timesheets.</p>

        <p>The Registration Application includes a simple REST API to access Account, Project, and User information. The
            service itself is very minimal, leaving domain logic within components. The Allocations, Backlog, and
            Timesheets Applications include a REST API, domain logic, and persistence layer. An alternate structure
            might have been to create components for each feature group similar to the Registration Application.</p>

                        aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single Repository</h3>

            <p>You'll notice that I've maintained a single Git repo. The single repo significantly reduces the
                overhead and complexity of API (in-process) versioning while enabling cross-component refactorings. The
                assumption is that Applications are stateless, well-tested, and able to be deployed with the larger
                suite of
                Components and Applications regardless of any local changes. They are also only consumed by the single
                "large" system. I understand that this topic is slightly controversial although, I highly encourage you
                to
                explore having a single repository.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The transition from step v5 to v6 shouldn't be taken lightly. The move to microservices is more than
            just an
            implementation detail and requires real and continued attention. Service availability (retry) and versioning
            (especially deploying "breaking changes") are just a few of the topics that become top of mind daily.</p>

        <p><span class="architecture">Design decision</span> Components include both Record and Info classes.
        This is to ensure that an individual component's public API is decoupled from its internal database schema / implementation
        - i.e. you could change a component's underlying database technology or version an API without
        impacting existing clients.</p>

        <p><span class="architecture">Design decision</span> You'll notice that Controller classes are located within each component.
            I've never found a strong reason to keep controllers or data access objects anywhere else other than local to the component - i.e. everything
            you need to know about a given bounded context is in one place. The design decision makes evolving the component to a microservice significantly less painful.

        </h5>

        <p>The v6 commit demonstrates a microservices architecture - Allocations, Backlog and Timesheet applications are
            dependent on the Registration service via REST.

<img class="continuum" src="images/continuum-diagram.png" alt="">

        <p>I've found that scaling both teams and performance are typically the main drivers for moving components to
            services for single systems; reuse, in this case, being another main driver. Reuse tends to be the main
        driver for moving components to their own repository.

    </p>


        <p>Lastly, you'll find an integration or acceptance test that "flows" through the suite of services and a
            multi-service manifest file for deployment.
        </p>



        <p>
            <span class="architecture">Design decision</span> I've intentionally duplicated Info and Client classes in
            each of the Allocations, Backlog and Timesheets components. While your first instinct might be to create a common "project-client" or "domain" component,
            this duplication sets up for seamless versioning and moving components to separate Git repos as your team
            grows.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="architecture">Design decision</span> You'll notice that I did not include or commit any

            user names, passwords, service location settings, etc.
            I've intentionally left this to the environment ensuring that the same artifact could truly be deployed to
            any environment;
            development, review, or production.

            <p>I tend to start all new projects with the 3 top level directories - applications, components, and databases.
                While following the continuum, I've found that the first few steps happen so quickly, weeks versus
                months, that it is easier to start every project with a component based directory structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Kotlin or Java projects, I tend to use gradle and include gradlew - resulting in the below initial directory structure.</p>

            <pre><code>
appcontinuum
├── applications
├── build.gradle
├── components
├── databases
├── gradle
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── manifest.yml

        </h3>

        <p>That's a wrap! Assuming you're on board with the continuum, I'm hopeful the project has given you insight in
            how an application evolves over time.</p>

        <p>Applications may start anywhere on the continuum depending on how much information the team has at the start
            of the project; greenfield applications without product /market fit may start left while big existing
            product
            re-writes may start on the far right. Functional groupings could prove challenging when evolving along the
            continuum. Finally, it's also worth mentioning that not all applications need to evolve and could stop
            anywhere on the continuum.</p>
